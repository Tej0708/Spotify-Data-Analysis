# Spotify-Data-Analysis
This project is an in-depth analysis on Spotify 2023 data. I am trying to answer questions about what constitutes a top song on Spotify. I used several python libraries to conduct this analysis including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. For analysis, I analyzed certain visualizations like boxplots, bar graphs, and histograms. In addition, one of the analyses uses linear regression and a heatmap to show correlation.
